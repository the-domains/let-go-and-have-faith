Hi,

Sebastian here and I am extremely excited to get to share something very special with you.

Are you ready...       

YOU ARE AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO BE A WORLD CLASS LEADER WHO CAN MAKE A HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PLANET!

Did you know that...

Over the next 4 weeks, I will be unlocking the greatness you've always had inside you. You are so powerful beyond your imagination, it is difficult to fathom how extraordinary you are. HOWEVER, somewhere along the process you forgot that. You began to doubt yourself and compare yourself to others.

Ever feel like you are not good enough?

I know what that feels like, I was there!

What if that could DISAPPEAR FOREVER!

Are you ready to remember how AMAZING YOU ALREADY ARE!

Here's how the "Unleash Your Inner Light Course" works:

In the next 30 days, you will be experiencing QUANTUM GROWTH in the world of accomplishments. 

You will experience BEING:

\*A Leader:

You will lead yourself into greatness, following your passion and listening to your heart, and when you pause to look behind, you have a team of committed extraordinary partners supporting you and your cause. 

\*A Fulfilled Entrepreneur:

You will understand the significance of value, and see opportunities that most people over look. You will understand and apply critical steps to ensure a successful business FOUNDATION.

\*A Fitness Beast:

You will experience the importance of being physically fit, and enjoy the perks of knowing that you are on your way to upgrading your temple, your body. You will get connected with proper yoga techniques and other meditation exercises to connect deeper with your body.

\*Part of a Tribe:

You will understand the value in working together, for the wellbeing of your group. You will gain experience in creating your own powerful tribe, and learn how to expand it around the world.

****

# HERE'S WHERE THE TRANSFORMATION HAPPENS...

What if I told you that quantum growth is attainable once you discover these three things:

****

Who you are?

When you fully wake up to the reality of who you are, something happens. It's a magical moment that you cannot put into words. You are reborn and unstoppable. FEAR becomes irrelevant and has no power over you. There is NOTHING or ANYBODY that can get in the way of you and what you want.

****

What is your Purpose?

Mark Twain said it best, "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why." Yes, it really is that impactful! Having a sense of direction, a reason to exist, something to die for. This gives you the motive everyday to wake up and give it EVERYTHING YOU GOT, not because you have to, but because you WANT TO.

****

What are you worth?

If you knew for a fact that you were worth $5,000 an hour, would you tolerate anything less? Well, what if you were worth much more than that?  We walk around this world accepting payments from people left and right; whether it's your employer, your clients, the public with tips, or any exchange of your value for money. Well what if you were getting the short end of the stick? Would you be able to recognize it? Earning what you are worth does not necessarily mean working harder, but rather effectively with flow.

# THIS IS THE FOUNDATION TO BUILD A FULFILLED LIFE

# PUTTING IN THE WORK

ADVENTURE DAY

Every Saturday for 4 weeks straight we will have our "ADVENTURE".

****

This is what seperates our coaching program from anybody else including top names like Les Brown and Tony Robbins. On our big day, you and I are going to live in world where possibilities are endless and reality is altered. We are having an adventure filled with surprises and extraordinary life lessons. We have dynamically created experiences that will have you look into your life. This is like no other coaching before, we focus on creating life altering experiences doing things most people never do anymore. 

****

An example of one of our BIG DAY's:

We start early morning in Downtown San Diego building a garden with foster children and sharing with them the importance of plants to our eco-system.

(Spiritual)

****

Afterwards, we head over to the shore on our bikes for lunch. Once lunch is over, we walk to a near park and discover yoga on a personal level. We meditate and guide the body to a state ready for action as we head into the woods for a late afternoon hike.

(Body/Physical)

****

Throughout the day we are distinguishing values, exploring limiting beliefs, sharing authentically, discovering doubts and fears, and we finish it off gathering on the beach discussing our discoveries around a bonfire.

(Mind)

****

You can expect these days to be completely off the wall yet filled with adventures and amazing experiences.

****

ACTIVIES WE WILL BE DOING INCLUDE:

****

Hiking

Surfing

Meditating

RESULT MASTERMIND

Once a week we will have a group mastermind. These are our strategy sessions where we turn your passion into a business and create all the personal activities for the week, focusing on producing RESULTS.

****

THIS IS POWERFUL STUFF!

****

Imagine having the ability to live your life doing exactly what you love to do and able to create the type of lifestyle you've always dreamed of. Do you work too hard? Do you have TIME? Are you living the life of your dreams doing what you love at every moment? Do you think it is possible?

****

The intention of these masterminds is to formulate a step by step action plan to take your passion and turn it into value within 30 days. 

****

Expect special guest to join us and share with us their own personal exercises they use to create their success.

****

The location ALWAYS CHANGES. One day it may be at the beach, another at a small coffee shop.

****

INNER WORK HEALING

One day out of the week you will be working with me personally where we will be working one on one getting you out of your head and into action. This is where you and I go deep and get to work on distinguishing your mental blueprint. Distinguish your past from your present and how it affects your future. Focus is Learning to let go and have faith.

****

This is where it all comes together!

****

After being around you for multiple occasions throughout the week, we have shared experiences that aids me in getting into your world and not just hear it from your thoughts and memories. This is the most premiere type of coaching as we go to work in deeply rooted experiences that cause most of our surface pain that often lead into self-sabatoging activities. You will begin to seek your own answers from within and begin to live fulfilled as the three most important questions of your life become revealed to you. 

OUR FOCUS

Discovering "Self"

Discovering your "Purpose"

Discovering your  worth

Increasing your Lifestyle

Leading on a Global level
